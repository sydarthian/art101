			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to get us in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I got a little confused, I thought we were supposed to pseudocode in the HTML file but that wasn’t working. I realized I needed to put it in the JavaScript file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab taught me about pseudocoding and helped me improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h3>Everyday task list:</h3>
					Doing eyeliner (Syd’s method)
					<ol>
						<li>Buy an eyeliner pen and scotch tape</li>
						<li>Sit in front of a mirror</li>
						<li>Put a small strip of tape where you want the bottom line of the eyeliner to go.</li>
						<li>Draw a line along the tape, then fill in the rest, following the shape of the eye.</li>
						<li>Remote tape and apply it to the other eye. Try to place it in the same position as the first eye.</li>
						<li>Try to fill in the eyeliner the same as the first eye so they look symmetrical.</li>
						<li>Fail to make it symmetrical and redo multiple times.</li>
						<li>Feel frustrated. </li>
						<li>After several attempts, get them somewhat even and say “good enough”. </li>
						
					  </ol>
					  <h3>Rock Paper Scissors game list:</h3>
					  <ol>
						  <li>Display game instructions</li>
						  <li>Get player input - Prompt the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors.</li>
						  <li>Validate player input</li>
						  <li>Generate computer choice - Randomly select rock, paper, or scissors for the computer.</li>
						  <li>Determine the winner - Compare the player’s choice and the computer’s choice. Apply the rules (rock beats scissors, etc.).</li>
						  <li>Display the result - Show what both sides chose and who won.</li>
						  <li>Ask to play again - Allow the player to decide whether to play another round or exit.</li>
						  <li>Loop or exit - If the player wants to play again, repeat from step 2. Otherwise, end the game with a closing message.</li>
						</ol>
